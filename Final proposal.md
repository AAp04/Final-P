# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Cat Vs Dog Vs Humans  - https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/cats-vs-dogs/0 
The new thing I added was Human

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

AI detacting system that can detect Cats, dogs, Humans, and other objects.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My Project will basically input a image from the user and try to figure out if the image is of a Cat Vs Dog Vs Humans other object. In order for this project to be exectued it needs to build on python. First data needs to be gathered and then that data will be imported to python and will be exexuted.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

no

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

no

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will become independent and have motivation to write code by my self.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I will accomplish being independent not relible on my TA or my professor.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish improvement in writing my code. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I Goign forward I will need alot of data which will used in the project. The data will be imported to python and they my code will run that data and identify if the image is a dog, cat, or a human.
